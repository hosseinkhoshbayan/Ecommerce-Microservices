Building an Amazon-Style Microservices E-commerce Platform! 💻
latest Visual Studio 2026, GitHub Copilot, and .NET 10 releases.

🎯 Phase 1: Backend Microservices Development

The foundation is built on robust, scalable services using .NET Core and the Clean Architecture principles.

Architectural Patterns: Implementing advanced patterns like CQRS, Pub-Sub, and Event-Driven Communications for high performance and decoupling.

Resilience & Reliability: Utilizing Saga and Outbox patterns to ensure data consistency and system resilience across services.

Core Engineering: Leveraging Repository, Specification, and Factory patterns for clean, testable code.

Data Persistence: Employing a Polyglot Persistence strategy with SQL Server, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Redis.

Inter-Service Communication: Facilitating fast, reliable messaging and communication with RabbitMQ and gRPC.

Local Setup: The entire microservices ecosystem runs locally on Docker containers.

🎨 Phase 2: Frontend (User Interface Layer)

Building a fully functional e-commerce web application inspired by the Amazon user experience.

Developed with Angular, calling APIs from the backend seamlessly.

Implementing modern UI features: robust product listing, dynamic filtering, shopping cart management, and a secure checkout process.

Focusing on Error Handling, Pagination, and Responsive Design to deliver a market-ready online store experience.

☁️ Phase 3: Infrastructure and Deployment (Cloud-Native)

Moving from local containers to a scalable, production-grade cloud infrastructure.

Deployment: Cloud-native deployment on Azure.

Automation: Setting up a full CI/CD pipeline.

Orchestration: Deploying microservices confidently on Kubernetes (AKS).

Traffic & Observability: Managing inter-service traffic and enhancing visibility using the Istio Service Mesh.

Deployment Automation: Automating deployment processes with Helm charts.

Monitoring: Integrating with Grafana and Prometheus for robust logging and monitoring.
